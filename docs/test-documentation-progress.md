# Test Documentation Progress Tracker

This file tracks the progress of adding comprehensive documentation to all test files in the async-python-cassandra-client project.

## Documentation Standards
Each test file should have:
1. File-level docstring explaining the test module's purpose
2. Class-level docstrings for test classes
3. Method-level docstrings using the format:
   - What this tests
   - Why this matters
   - Test details/steps

## Documentation Pattern Used

Each test method now includes:
```python
"""
Brief description of test.

What this tests:
---------------
1. Specific behavior being tested
2. Edge cases covered
3. Expected outcomes
4. Integration points

Why this matters:
----------------
- Real-world implications
- Common use cases
- Potential bugs prevented
- Production scenarios

Additional context (when relevant):
---------------------------------
- Example code snippets
- Common pitfalls
- Related patterns
