### ❓ Stress Tests - NOT COMPLETED (timeout)

## Known Issues:

1. **FastAPI Reconnection Tests**: The FastAPI app is not reconnecting properly after Cassandra outages in the BDD tests. This appears to be a test setup issue rather than a library issue (proven by integration test that shows both raw driver and wrapper reconnect correctly).

2. **Task Scheduler Error**: "RuntimeError: cannot schedule new futures after shutdown" appears at the end of BDD tests, indicating the Cassandra driver's internal scheduler is still trying to run after shutdown.

3. **Test Duration**: The full test suite takes over 40 minutes to run, which may be too long for regular development cycles.

## Recommendations:

1. Investigate why the FastAPI reconnection BDD tests fail locally but pass on GitHub CI
2. Consider adding shorter test targets for quick validation during development
3. The task scheduler error needs investigation - may need longer waits after cluster shutdown
4. Consider parallelizing test execution to reduce total runtime

## Test Infrastructure Changes Made:

1. **Container Naming**: All tests now use consistent container name `async-cassandra-test`
2. **Container Cleanup**: Each test phase gets a fresh Cassandra container
3. **Endpoint Snitch**: All configurations now use `GossipingPropertyFileSnitch` for production-like behavior
4. **Memory Settings**: Aligned at 4GB container memory, 3GB heap
5. **No Test Skipping**: Removed all `@pytest.mark.skipif` decorators per ABSOLUTE RULES
