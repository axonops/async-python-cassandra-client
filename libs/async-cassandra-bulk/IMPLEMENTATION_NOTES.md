# Implementation Notes - Writetime Export Feature

## Session Context
This implementation was completed across multiple sessions due to context limits. Here's what was accomplished:

### Session 1 (Previous)
- Initial TDD setup and unit tests
- Basic writetime implementation
- Initial integration tests

### Session 2 (Current)
- Fixed all test failures
- Enhanced checkpoint/resume functionality
- Added comprehensive integration tests
- Fixed all linting errors

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Query Generation Strategy
We modify the CQL query to include WRITETIME() functions:
```sql
-- Original
SELECT id, name, value FROM table

-- With writetime
SELECT id, name, WRITETIME(name) AS name_writetime, value, WRITETIME(value) AS value_writetime FROM table
```

### 2. Counter Column Handling
Counter columns don't support WRITETIME() in Cassandra, so we:
1. Detect counter columns via `col_meta.cql_type == 'counter'`
2. Exclude them from writetime query generation
3. Exclude them from CSV/JSON headers

### 3. Checkpoint Enhancement
The checkpoint now includes the full export configuration:
```python
checkpoint = {
    "version": "1.0",
    "completed_ranges": [...],
    "total_rows": 12345,
    "export_config": {
        "table": "keyspace.table",
        "columns": ["col1", "col2"],
        "writetime_columns": ["col1"],  # Preserved!
        "batch_size": 1000,
        "concurrency": 4
    }
}
```

### 4. Collection Column Handling
Collection columns (list, set, map) return a list of writetime values:
```python
# Handle list values in WritetimeSerializer
if isinstance(value, list):
    if value:
        value = value[0]  # Use first writetime
    else:
        return None
```

## Testing Philosophy

All tests follow CLAUDE.md requirements:
1. Test-first development (TDD)
2. Comprehensive documentation in each test
3. Real Cassandra for integration tests (no mocks)
4. Edge cases and error scenarios covered
5. Performance and stress testing included

## Error Handling Evolution

### Initial Issues
1. **TypeError with collections** - Fixed by handling list values
2. **RuntimeError on resume** - Fixed header management
3. **Counter columns** - Fixed by proper type detection

### Resolution Pattern
Each fix followed this pattern:
1. Reproduce in test
2. Understand root cause
3. Implement minimal fix
4. Verify all tests pass
5. Add regression test

## Performance Considerations

1. **Minimal overhead when disabled** - No WRITETIME() in query
2. **Linear scaling** - Overhead proportional to writetime columns
3. **Memory efficient** - Streaming not affected
4. **Checkpoint overhead minimal** - Only adds config to existing checkpoint

## Code Quality

### Linting Compliance
- All F841 (unused variables) fixed
- E722 (bare except) fixed
- F821 (undefined names) fixed
- Import ordering fixed by isort
- Black formatting applied
- Type hints maintained

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: Query generation, serialization, configuration
- Integration tests: Full export scenarios, error cases
- Stress tests: High concurrency, large datasets
- Example code: Demonstrates all features

## Lessons Learned

1. **Collection columns are tricky** - Always test with maps, lists, sets
2. **Counter columns are special** - Must be detected and excluded
3. **Resume must preserve config** - Users expect same behavior
4. **Token wraparound matters** - Edge cases at MIN/MAX tokens
5. **Real tests find real bugs** - Mocks would have missed several issues

## Future Considerations

1. **Writetime filtering** - Export only recently updated rows
2. **TTL support** - Export TTL alongside writetime
3. **Incremental exports** - Use writetime for change detection
4. **Writetime statistics** - Min/max/avg in export summary

## Maintenance Notes

When modifying this feature:
1. Run full test suite including stress tests
2. Test with real Cassandra cluster
3. Verify checkpoint compatibility
4. Check performance impact
5. Update examples if API changes
